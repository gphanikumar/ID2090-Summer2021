\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item curl of magnetic field is nothing but equal of the sum of current density and partial (derivative of electric field* epsilon) and whole multiply with mue0.
    
    it state that changing elecric current or flux can produce magnetic field around that surface.
    
    electric current and charges are proptional to magnetic field around that closed surface path.
\end{itemize}
