\Large \textbf {Mass - energy equivalence:}

$$  E= mc^2$$

where, 

\quad\quad {E: energy of a particle in its rest frame}

\quad\quad m: mass of the particle

\quad\quad c: speed of light  

\paragraph \normalsize{Einstein's greatest equation, is a triumph of the power and simplicity of fundamental physics. Matter has an inherent amount of energy to it, mass can be converted (under the right conditions) to pure energy, and energy can be used to create massive objects that did not exist previously.}
