\subsection{My favourite equation in physics is Einstein's famous equation:} 

$E=mc^2$

\subsection{Description:}
"To me this was a puzzle that didn't make much sense to me when i was young,when all i know that time was conservation of mass and nuclear reactions were an exception.But growing up,i got a bit of clarification about this spicy equation:'Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.'"

On the most basic level, the equation says that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing.

A higher level explanation would be "whenever you convert part of a any matter(mass), the resulting energy is by definition moving at the speed of light. Pure energy is electromagnetic radiation,whether light or X-rays or whatever and electromagnetic radiation travels at a constant speed of 300,000 km/sec".

\subsection{TERMS:}
                       $E$: Energy
                       $m$:mass 
                       $c$:speed of light.
