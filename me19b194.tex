\subsection{The Schr\"odinger Wave Equation}
{
The Schr\"odinger Wave Equation named after Erwin Schr\"odinger is a partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum particle over time. The Schr\"odinger equations are analogous to Newtons laws of motion in the quantum mechanical world
    \begin{equation}
        i \hbar {\partial \over \partial t} \Psi (\vec{r},t) = \left[{-			        \hbar^2 \over 2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r},t)\right] \Psi (\vec{r},t)
    \end{equation}
}

\subsection{The meaning of the terms used}
{
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Psi (\vec{r},t)$ is the wave function defined over space and time
\item $i$ is the imaginary number $\sqrt{-1}$
\item $\hbar$ is the plancks constant $h$ divided by $2\pi$
\item $m$ is the mass of the particle
\item $V(\vec{r},t)$ is the potential energy of the particle varying over space and time
\item $\nabla^2$ is the laplacian operater ${\partial^2 \over \partial^2 x} + {\partial^2 \over \partial^2 y} + {\partial^2 \over \partial^2 z}$
\end{itemize}
