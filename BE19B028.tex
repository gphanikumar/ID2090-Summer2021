\subsection{Newton's Second Law of Motion}

 
{




Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. 


   F = M A 












WHERE F IS FORCE ACTING ON THE BODY AND M IS THE MASS OF THE BODY AND A IS THE ACCELERATION

\subsection{Applications}
{

Newton's laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve motion problems. Some problems contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Some motion problems contain several physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position.
