\section{My Favourite Physics Equation}
\hspace{6mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:main_eq}
\Large
      \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\Delta^2{\Psi} + V\Psi = i\hbar{\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}}
\end{equation}
\\
The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system. It is a key result in quantum mechanics, and its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of the subject.
\\
\\
In simple words, the equation represents that the total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy. \\
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sim_eq}
\Large
    KE+PE=TE
\end{equation}
\\
Each terms of equation \ref{eqn:main_eq} and \ref{eqn:sim_eq} can be compared easily. Hence, schrödinger's wave equation is nothing but an Energy Conservation Equation.
