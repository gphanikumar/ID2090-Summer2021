\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{a} \times \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
+ \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} + \frac{q}{k}
\label{Multi-dimensional Heat Conduction Equation}
\end{equation}
    This equation is called the \textbf{Multi-dimensional Heat Conduction Equation}. 
Its variants are used in diverse fields, such as explaining Brownian motion in Probability Theory, 
Wave Function characteristics in Quantum Mechanics and also in solving the Black Scholes PDE in financial mathematics.
It determines the Temperature distribution $T$ for a 3D unsteady Heat Conduction
problem with Heat Generation and requires six Boundary Conditions, (two for
each axis, $x$, $y$, and $z$) and one initial condition for the Time dependence $t$. The rate of Heat
Generation is given by $q$ and the thermal conductivity of the material is given by $k$. Here, $a$ is a constant.
