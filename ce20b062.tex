In 1924, Louis de Broglie used Einstein's equation E=mc2 and incorporated it with Planck's equation. This brought together the relationship of the mass of a photon and speed of light with the photon energy.
He reasoned that if things that acted like waves had particle characteristics then it should work vice versa. Therefore, things that behave like particles should also have wave characteristics. He coined the term "matter waves" to describe waves that involved material particles, such as electrons. }
