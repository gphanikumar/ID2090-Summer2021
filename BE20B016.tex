Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there is inherent uncertainty in the act of measuring a variable of a particle. More specifically, if one knows the precise momentum of the particle, it is impossible to know the precise position, and vice versa. It is a fundamental theory in quantum mechanics that defines why a scientist cannot measure multiple quantum variables simultaneously. Until the dawn of quantum mechanics, it was held as a fact that all variables of an object could be known to exact precision simultaneously for a given moment. Heisenberg made the bold proposition that there is a lower limit to this precision making our knowledge of a particle inherently uncertain. This relationship also applies to energy and time, in that one cannot measure the precise energy of a system in a finite amount of time.
