My favourite physics equation is possibly the most famous equation in the history of physics, but it became popular for all the wrong reason.Despite of its fundamental importance in making us understand how different the world really is to how we perceived it a century ago, its fame is mostly because of its association with one of the most devastating weapons produced by humans â€“ the atomic bomb.Yes, so my favourite physics equation is Einstein's Mass Energy Equivalence.

\begin{empheq}[box=\fcolorbox{Red}{White}]{align*}
E&=mc^2
\end{empheq}

This equation was a game changer.In Einstein's new world, mass became a way to measure the total energy present in an object, even when it was not being heated, moved or irradiated or whatever else. Mass is just a super-concentrated form of energy and, moreover, these things can turn from one form to the other and back again, if only we could find a way to do it.

\bigskip
It is possible to achieve this conversion, for example nuclear power stations exploit this idea inside their reactors. For all the extensive and monumental applications this equation is known for, it's astounding to me that this equation gained it's popularity mainly because of the atomic bomb, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.If we look into it, it is highly unlikely that Einstein's equation was much use in designing the bomb, beyond making scientists and military leaders realise that such a thing would be theoretically possible, but the association has stuck. Possibly because of this rich history behind it, this is probably my favourite equation of all time.
