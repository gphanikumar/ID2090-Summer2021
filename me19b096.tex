\subsection{Bernoulli's Equation}
{
This equation states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in its potential energy. This equation is only applicable for isentropic flows: where irreversibilities can be neglected.
For a compressible flow the equation along a streamline can be stated as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{v^2}{2} + \int_{p_{1}}^{p} {\frac{\mathrm{d}{\tilde{p}}}{\rho\left({\tilde{p}}\right)}} + \Psi ={\text{constant}}
\end{equation}
 where :
  \begin{itemize}
      \item $v$ is the flow speed
      \item $p$ is the pressure
      \item $\rho$ is the density and $\rho\left(\tilde{p}\right)$ denotes that it's a function of pressure
      \item $\Psi$ is the potential associated with the conservative force field, often the gravitational potential
  \end{itemize}
}
\subsection{Applications}
 {
 In everyday life there are many observations that can be successfully explained through this equation.
 it can be used to calculate the lift force on an airfoil, explain the swinging of a cricket ball,explain the venturi effect and many more.
