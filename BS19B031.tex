$E=mc^2$
\\
The formula defines the energy E of a particle in its rest frame as the product of mass with the speed of light squared. Because the speed of light is a large number in everyday units, the formula implies that a small amount of rest mass corresponds to an enormous amount of energy, which is independent of the composition of the matter.
