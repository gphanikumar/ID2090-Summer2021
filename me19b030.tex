\textbf{Heisenberg's uncertainty principle}
\begin{equation}
{\texorpdfstring{\sigma\textsubscript{x}}\texorpdfstring{\sigma\textsubscript{y}}}\geq\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\end{equation}
In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, such as position, x, and momentum, p, can be predicted from initial conditions.
