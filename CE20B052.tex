\begin{equation}
    \oint_S {E = mc^2} Q_{in}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $ E_n $  refers to the component of the electric field, normal to the area.
	\item $ dA $  refers to the differential area which is integrated over a closed surface.
	\item $ \varepsilon _0 $ is the vacuum permittivity.
	\item $ Q_{in} $ refers to the total net charged enclosed inside the closed surface.
