\textbf{Heisenberg's uncertainty principle}
\begin{equation}
{\Delta x \Delta y}\geq\frac{h}{4\pi} 
\end{equation}
The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.[15] So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.
