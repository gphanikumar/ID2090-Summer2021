\paragraph{ De Broglie Wave Equation}


       \[ \lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv} \]
        

	\hspace{1cm}	${\displaystyle where,}$ 
   
    
    \hspace{2cm}     $\lambda$ is the wavelength associated with the particle
         
        
    \hspace{2cm}      ${\displaystyle h}$  is the Planck's constant. 
        
     \hspace{2cm}     ${\displaystyle p}$  is the momentum of the particle
         
     \hspace{2cm}     ${\displaystyle m}$  is the mass of the partice
         
     \hspace{2cm}     ${\displaystyle v}$ is the velocity of the particle
        
\subparagraph{}   
The De Broglie Wave Equation is very simple but the meaning that it entails is the fundamental idea or rather the foundation of quantum mechanics. The idea is as simple as the equation, that is, a particle can exhibit wave characteristics. This is a fundamental equation of the wave particle duality concept which is quite interesting and paves way for new types of physics.

 Thus, this very simple equation is my favourite for its simplicity yet the massive meaning that it holds.
