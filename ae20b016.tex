	\section{Physics Equation}

	One of my favourite Physics eqation is $a = - \omega ^2 x = - \omega ^2 A\sin (\omega t)$. This is the a-x equation of a body executing SHM. This can be converted to a second degree differential equation to solve for x (displacement from the mean position). The standard solution for x (assuming the body starts from its mean position) is $x=A\sin (\omega t)$ where $\omega$ is the angualar frequency of SHM, $t$ is time and $\omega = {\frac{2\pi}{T}}$ where $T$ is the time period of oscilation of the SHM.
