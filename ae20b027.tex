Coloumb's Law of Electrostatic Force 

\end{center}


The columbs law of electrostatic forces describe the force between two charges which are stationary. 
The interaction between charged objects is a non-contact force that acts over some distance of separation. Charge, charge and distance. Every electrical interaction involves a force that highlights the importance of these three variables. Whether it is a plastic golf tube attracting paper bits, two like-charged balloons repelling or a charged Styrofoam plate interacting with electrons in a piece of aluminum, there is always two charges and a distance between them as the three critical variables that influence the strength of the interaction.
\begin{equation}
F= 1\over {4 \times \pi \times \epsilon} \times Q_1 \times Q_2 \over r^2
\end{equation}
