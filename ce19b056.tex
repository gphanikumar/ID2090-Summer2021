\subsection{Einstein's Energy-Mass Equivalence}
This equation states that mass $(m)$ and Energy $(E)$ of a matter is related. And it is related by following equation.
\begin{equation}
    E=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}
    \label{Energy-Mass Equivalence Relation}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$E$] is the Energy in matter
    \item[$m$] is the mass of matter
    \item[$v$] is the velocity of matter
    \item[$c$] is the velocity of speed in vaccum
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Facts about  Equation 
\ref{Energy-Mass Equivalence Relation}}
This theory was first published in $1905$ and the equation\ref{Energy-Mass Equivalence Relation} was published in $1912$ by $Sir Albert Einsteen$.This equation is wildly used in nuclear physics.


According to this equation\ref{Energy-Mass Equivalence Relation} when particle speed $v$ approach speed of light $c$ the Energy stored $E$ and mass $m$ become infinite
