\centerline{\huge \textbf{Ampere's Law}}

\begin{equation}
    \vec\nabla \times \vec B = \mu_0 \vec J + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec E}{\partial t}
\end{equation}


\begin{itemize}
    \item A circulating magnetic field is produced by an electric current and by an electric field that changes with time.
    
    \item it is basically for displacement current finding formula which is produced by magnetic field
    
    \item electric current and charges are proptional to magnetic field around that closed surface path.
\end{itemize}


\centerline{\textbf{B = magnetic field}}
\centerline{\textbf{J = current density}}
\centerline{\textbf{E = electric field}}
