\section{My Favourite Physics Equation}
\hspace{6mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:main_eq}
\Large
     f=ma
\end{equation}
\\
this equation may seem simple,but this is the base of physics that we do in every day life \\
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sim_eq}
\Large
    \frac{\Delta f}{t}=\Delta mv
\end{equation}
\\
The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, or, for an object with constant mass, that the net force on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration
