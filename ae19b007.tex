\hspace{6mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:main_eq}
\Large
    L = \frac{1}{2}C_l\rho S v^2
\end{equation}
\\
This equation represents lift produced by a airfoil section of surface are S,. Here $\rho$ represents density of air , v represents speed of air, $C_l$ is the coefficient of lift that depends on angle of attack and wing shape\\
