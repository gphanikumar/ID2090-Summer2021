\begin{flushleft}
\[ 
F = G \left( \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \right)
\]
\begin{itemize}
  \item F is the force between the masses
  \item $G=6.674*10 ^{-11}  m^{3}kg^{-1}s^{-2}$ is the gravity constant
  \item m1 is the first mass
  \item m2 is the second mass
  \item is the distance between the centers of the masses.
\end{itemize}


\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}
Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers
