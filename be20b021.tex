\paragraph{This is known as the Stoke's law derived by George Stokes in 1851 to determine the frictional force also called the drag force that is acted upon spherical objects with very small Reynold's number in viscous fluids.The drag force F is equal to the product of the radius of the sphere(R),velocity with which it falls(v) and the viscosity of the liquid(eta) multiplied with the constant pi.It has numerous applications in the field of fluid dynamics.}
