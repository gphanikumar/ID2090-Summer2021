\centerline{\textbf{Schr\"{o}dinger's Equation}}
The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation is as follows:
\begin{equation}
\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
\end{equation}
The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system.Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of Quantum Mechanics.The Schrödinger equation is the quantum counterpart of Newton's second law in classical mechanics.The Schrödinger equation gives the evolution over time of a wave function, the quantum-mechanical characterization of an isolated physical system.
