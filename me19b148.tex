\section{Newton’s Laws of Motion} 
Newton’s first law says: ‘‘Newton’s first law states that if a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force"

Newton’s second law is 
\begin{equation} 
\vec F = m \vec a
\end{equation}
where $\vec F$ is the force on a particle of mass $m$, 
and $\vec a$ is the particle’s acceleration.
Newton's Third Law says:"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"
